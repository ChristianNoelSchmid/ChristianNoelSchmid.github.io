## How to Run

**Requirements**: Node / NPM, Angular CLI

To install the Angular CLI, which can be used to deploy a development server, build the project, and perform other tasks, use NPM: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Once the CLI is installed, pull this repo to your local system, and type the command `ng serve --open`. Note that the `--open` command will automatically open a web page to the correct port address once compiled.

While the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the site.
